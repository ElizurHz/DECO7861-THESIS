"DeviousKat89 the game is not the point. It's not a tournament."
"JasonLMatthews it sounds like a boom mic to me when we had everyone miced up :(I think individual audio would have taken too long to edit"
"Druiddroids fwiw we tried addressing a lot of those ahead of time. The edit job decides whether this is 2/10 or 12/10 like I said yesterday"
"mattborchert nah 3 days notice. Files so long 6 hours of that is upload time. Needed a full week and WSOP editing."
"bcontant what quality issues are there? Audio could be better I agree. Sounds like boom mic."
"a lot more distant from the people at the table than it should. Was supposed to have zoomed in shots on whoever was talking."
"2: the editing ended up being what I specifically asked it not to be, which was using the overhead static shot mostly. That makes it feel"
"Well the event is pretty polarizing which was expected. 1: this is NOT a tournament. It's an event. Winning games doesn't earn  much gold"

"Kevin_Hitt maybe what we need is one for 12 or something. Just needs to be bigger but there are only 10 at most sitting there"
"Kevin_Hitt 10. Ours is also for 10 but it's small. How long and wide is yours?"
"Poker table got delivered today and it's smaller than I'd like. Anyone have a big one we can borrow for 2 days near Santa Ana? Will pay!"
