"MobotGG draws a different card which thins my deck to get to better cards. Prince does the opposite of that, and Moroes is just a bad card."
"joe_paras I think a 1 mana 1/1 body is too low impact and the consistency to fill your curve hurts for not enough benefit. Same with book."
"MobotGG I would rather run Purify than Moroes or Prince Malchezaar in pretty much every deck."
"JABLOL samzorzSH copies buffs as well, so just a lot of things that can happen with that card that are insanely good."
"PreettyGoood There is not a meta where it is the best option for what it aim to do. So it won't be played."

"nborton Frodan How many matches of discard zoo have gone to fatigue. The extra 5 in deck are only relevant in fatigue."
"MPasilis I mean you don't draw 5 so your hand isn't any bigger for discarding so you are saying you run bad cards to have cards to discard?"
"Chakki_HS don't forget firelands portal buff as well. This must be why everyone on twitter saying its op"
"MPasilis put 5 legendaries in your zoo and see how it feels on ladder. Like why is 35 cards better than 30 cards?"
"MPasilis hurts aggro curve because you have 5 random legendaries from the start of the game and already not 30 good aggro cards."

"Frodan Yeah first glance it looks bad. I'm also going to do all the math later and no for sure, but in my head the variance seems meme."
"SirManleyLenny Frodan The meta has been the same for 2 years. Control warrior, zoo, generic aggro deck, mid druid, rogue, mid hunter"
"HSpacman biggest complaint on last review was too long so going to try shorter one this time around. should be out tommorrow."
"ArnoldDante Sure I'dont know anything about arena but thatd make sense to me."
"HSpacman hs fans also consider a 5/6 with no board impact effect a good body, but turns out no competitive deck runs pit fighter."
"SirManleyLenny Frodan how many games do you get to survive to fatigue in?? for me its like 1/10 decks are real good with infinite time."
