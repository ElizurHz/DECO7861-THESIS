"PlayHearthstone: We're making some changes to certain cards in an upcoming update!  "

"Great video by StrifeCro on tournaments and rng "
"Frodan team format for 1v1 game is kind of unnecessary, but I think it would be super fun &amp; good for sponsors too"

"TidesofTime ByronBernstein yeah the potential is crazy, that's the source of much frustration right now"
"NYC_Glistening yes not saying the cards are bad, just that there is always rng"
