"loNimbTV we didn't make the changes to appease vocal people. We think they are the right thing to do."
"narsqt we tried to get it all into the blog post"
"RavenDragon2015 I think it's a slight enough change that it should still be fun to play. At least that's the hope."
"Velken_Iakov I think it's very slight. He was already not a good card in almost every deck and got play before."
"Adys wanted it to still grant Charge, but not be so abusable."
"PlayHearthstone: We're making some changes to certain cards in an upcoming update!  "

"Frodan the fact that this video came out only 2 days after Purify was revealed was pretty awesome :) "
"itsjawdan was just talking about this on twitter - what kind of insight wouldn't read like that to you?"
"Frodan things can sometimes reach critical mass quickly.  Purify was revealed on Friday night and we responded on Monday, for example."
"defmore89 doesn't mean we don't have room to improve!"
"AstyanaxHector i agree - does that mean we shouldn't be discussing our thoughts about things until we actually make a change?"
"davebaldelli "
"hazard07077 wwallrocha we do that and it hasn't been going perfect.  \"it's on our radar\" is basically a meme at this point."
"nickjgraves Sips_ i mean that if people are testing on the ptr, then the new set loses a lot of excitement of exploration on day 1"
"UncivilDKizzle harder to have a dialog in the world where we only discuss things once they're done"
"Sips_ i think launching a \"solved\" environment on day 1 is a pretty big downside of that"
"wwallrocha what if we don't know for sure what's coming until it's very close?  For example, tavern brawls changed a ton during development"
"DSzymborski yeah, I see that feeling and I feel a bit powerless to combat it, if we haven't reached decisions yet.  What to say to help?"
"Check out mike_donais and IksarHS's interview! Lots of insight into the types of things we're thinking about righ\u2026 "
"dmwerny "
"Shan_Whittaker part of the problem is interviews, where we don't know what people will ask, and all we can do is say what we're considering"
"PsycloneJoker I think you're right. Also 'reasonable' is pretty subjective. Adding Ranked Rewards, for example, took real time."
"Mithestral i think you hit the nail on the head.  Maybe it's not something we can tune about our communication style."
"YallaEsports yeah one of the problems with timelines is we often don't know until QA and our platform partners give a thumbs up to release"
"Shan_Whittaker i get feedback that we should communicate *more*. Also, people assume we don't agree or aren't listening when we say nothing"
"DarkVexon no, I mean, people say \"another interview with no answers\""
"When we haven't decided a course of action yet, what type of communication do folks want to hear?"
"I wonder if folks would rather we wait until we decide whether or not to do A, and just announce when we are doing it."
"It's interesting. When I post \"been thinking about doing A. Also, we are not considering B\", people say 'you said nothing'."
"Sylvexn_ boom! "
"Apple_or_Orange Airwoks_ did a vid on this a while back - "
"Masteryder I did a bunch of posting last week, but it's been especially busy recently. Hoping to chat a lot next week!"

"Nice! My new iPhone is coming on ${SHIPRANGE}! "
"Luciano_TLD he actually got legend level play not that long ago. Don't think many folks noticed."
"Airwoks_ a lot of the benefits of bad cards apply more to constructed than arena. Also, we had to do something with the tools we had."
