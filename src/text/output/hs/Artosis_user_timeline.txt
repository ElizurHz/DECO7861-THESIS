"ZvonimirKrunes and obviously anyone who can actually pay attention fully enters a flow state and crushes face."
"ZvonimirKrunes you can't pay attention to the minimap without looking at the minimap."
"ZvonimirKrunes with all of those things, you use the minimap to see incoming threats still."
"ZvonimirKrunes what? 10% more vision?"
"ZvonimirKrunes what?"
"InvasionHarstem super cool. Hope it gets here before I fly out for blizzcon"
"InvasionHarstem just ordered it. Have u used it much?"
"wizecrax i believe random won't have a rating, it will just do what that race is. but your main race will be stronger than normal !"
"is there any program that can track where my eyes go while playing SC? would like to measure how often i'm looking at mini-map if possible."
"ampersandpound well it matters how far players are currently from 100. if theoretical skill and speed gets too high, the game breaks down."
"AVEXyli looks amazing lol"
"AVEXyli nothing worries me as a caster. gimme a 5000000 player map i dont give a fuk"
"ampersandpound is this 100 rating achievable? would you put any current players with this score?"
"JohnSpasm hm i dunno if i'd call it unfair. random players won't be as good as players of one race. i'd call it luck-based tho."
"ampersandpound dunno what you consider theoretical most optimal player"
"AVEXyli better than 4player  thats for sure. still has some issues."
"Pokebunny yeah i'd personally prefer that. i guess they deserve an edge tho becuz they can't be as good with all 3 races as someone with 1"
"the only downside to the separate MMR per race is going to be the increase of playing vs Random on 4 player maps. that isn't what SC is."
"five days ago it was 30 in Korea. Then it rained for a few days. Woke up freezing and now its 6. w t f"
"RAPiDCasting LMFAO"
"if i ever lose anything, all i have to do to find it is think to myself how i don't want my dog to lay on it. he will surely find it for me."
"twice now I've hit GMs on the Korean server who have less than 4500 MMR. how is that possible?"
