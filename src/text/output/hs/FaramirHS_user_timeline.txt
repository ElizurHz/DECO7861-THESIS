"GGNydrA IAmCVH FalconePunch55 i had that before with black comedies/humor but this show has nothing to do with that imo"
"GGNydrA FalconePunch55 that really isnt it. i think theres a lot of overacting+poor writing/direction and its silly at times"

"Also sth i noticed : LukeCage goes harder on the MCU and netflix series references than any of the other series before"
"Shades couldve been cool but he seemed miscast and his writing was too weak to sell the character LukeCage"
"LukeCage himself is awesome but the characters, story and writing around him are a mess. Let's hope IronFist delivers more"
"dear god, this writing is dogshit"
"biggest problem with LukeCage : they don't know when to end a scene so the series is cluttered with unnecessary dialogue"
