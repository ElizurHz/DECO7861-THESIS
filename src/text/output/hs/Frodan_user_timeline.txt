"Thanks for the hosts Liquid_hsdog RostyHS, thanks to everyone who tuned in. Biggest stream we've had in a while :)"
"RaltheSA G2Rdu TPG_BoarControl that's pretty fair to say"
"Xzirezhs TidesofTime Tommyl_hs coL_Crane333 G2Rdu gotcha makes sense, blizz has the data to prove it too but they don't release it :("
"Xzirezhs TidesofTime Tommyl_hs coL_Crane333 G2Rdu ladder data + tournament data is good enough though no? Xixo is like clear tier 1"
"Xzirezhs TidesofTime Tommyl_hs coL_Crane333 G2Rdu ceiling is low right now but that only means it's harder to see. Some are better tho"
"Xzirezhs TidesofTime Tommyl_hs coL_Crane333 G2Rdu well there's empirical data they outperformed others so yeah, I'd say they are better"
"nR_WitaCCG TidesofTime Tommyl_hs coL_Crane333 TomflrHS Navi00T G2Rdu yep there's a case for Rdu as EU's 2016 POTY"
"LookItzJoe thanks joe, keep up the amazing work at VS and propelling the comm to new heights. DR is a godsend"
"DenisShiversky LOL"
"TidesofTime Tommyl_hs coL_Crane333 G2Rdu TomflrHS Navi00T they've outperformed others quite consistently tho, I'd agree with tommy"
"RaltheSA feel like I'm trying to be fair though? I try to show proper acknowledgment for his play and his results, how he has a point, etc"
"anusername yep I get his point, don't necessarily agree it's the casters fault but I can see where he's coming from"
"TPG_BoarControl but instead of trying to decipher and understand, you jump to a conclusion then harbor hate. Nothing else to do here"
"TPG_BoarControl people call me out all the time, threaten me, humiliate me, say random whatevers...you aren't there when I respond to them"
"TPG_BoarControl if you do any research you would find that 99% of the time the opposite is true, but you instead taking a couple examples"
"TPG_BoarControl many times people are tweeting just shorter condensed version of thoughts. You never even met me yet you label me like this"
"TPG_BoarControl brother Twitter has an easy way to misinterpret things and you've gone off the deep end, this is all from a couple tweets?"
"TPG_BoarControl but it's all good I don't have anything against you so if you're still upset over that I'm sorry. No point fighting over it"
"TPG_BoarControl pretty sure you unfollowed me when I made a clear joke with no real harm intended, so ofc you take things out of context"
"TPG_BoarControl G2Rdu georgec_hs selective reading tends to do that xD"
"G2Rdu TomflrHS Navi00T it doesn't change how great they were or how well you guys played or the acknowledgement you did/should receive"
"G2Rdu TomflrHS Navi00T but you are aware that the overwhelming majority of g2/nihilum results are from invites/\"unfair\" systems?"
"G2Rdu georgec_hs we praised George and drhippi. We didn't say HG is best in the world. We list his accomplishments. Fans appreciate it"
"G2Rdu TomflrHS Navi00T I'm just shocked that a great record was set and you immediately jump to fix public opinion before it even formed"
"G2Rdu TomflrHS Navi00T as someone who fought hard to prove himself (and did) and faced ppl discrediting it. How can you say this stuff?"
"G2Rdu TomflrHS Navi00T my problem with your tweet isn't your point about HCT. Alrdy get it. It's that you're being a salty baby."
"callumleslie92 Navi00T G2Rdu I mean APAC players knew the rules so everyone is going hard for 1. Changes the landscape some for sure"
"G2Rdu Navi00T but you dont step in to correct them with \"btw thijs got some of his 2015 pts thru invitationals\" when people praise his win"
"Navi00T callumleslie92 G2Rdu but everyone knows the rules...so they all go for the big points. He had to beat out ppl going for it still"
"G2Rdu Navi00T how am I hiding facts??? Why is it okay to celebrate thijs as the best when he does this two years running but not HG?"
"G2Rdu Navi00T how am I overexaggerating? I listed his accomplishments in 2016 and gave my opinion. No one is breaking that record."
"G2Rdu Navi00T no i said multiple times you have a point. But demeaning someone's achievement publicly after they work so hard is weak dude"
"G2Rdu Navi00T thijs is great &amp; I love all of you guys at g2 but cmon a lot of accomplishments in HS are based on invites/\"unfair\" system"
"G2Rdu Navi00T your teammate is bolstered primarily on that too but I don't see you trying to criticize how he won over the years"
"Navi00T G2Rdu literally a handful of minutes after his win. Sure system isn't perfect but neither was the time thijs won 2015 EU champs"
"Navi00T G2Rdu right after a guy does a super hard thing at a time when Competitive HS is heavy variance he retorts why it means less"
"Navi00T G2Rdu hell yeah he's salty look at his tweets lol. Doesn't mean he's wrong tho, I see his point"
"NexusMooDy G2Rdu keep dumping on others' achievements and see who claps when you finally get your turn ;)"
"G2Rdu I see your point but his appearances still have merit. He could have adjusted point grinding based on lead. Knows he needs fewer pts"
"G2Rdu but I do think 1 should be invited. You as the eu leader should have earned a spot in the seasonal champs too"
"G2Rdu I disagree. It's a championship tour and past performance should be recognized from event to event."
"G2Rdu he still had to grind ladder and consistently finish high. You act as if he got 2nd in winter then coasted the rest of the year"
"G2Rdu trying to undermine his achievement is the opposite of what you want, imo you instead should advocate that EU/NA adopt it"
"G2Rdu I get that you're salty because you grinded hard but you should be happy for someone else who worked super hard and plays well"
"G2Rdu he still worked hard through ladder/events every season to get pointsAnd it's not even close"
